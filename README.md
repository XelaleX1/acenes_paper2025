This repository contains electronic supporting information for the paper "Effect of Thermal Disorder on the Electronic Structure and the Charge Mobility of
Acenes", by Alessandro Landi, Francesco Ambrosio, Anna Leo, Daniele Padula, Giacomo Prampolini, and Andrea Peluso, submitted to Small (2025)

In this folder there are gromacs topologies for the two molecules studied, as obtained with the Joyce protocol. Atomic charges are derived from the RESP procedure, while non-bonded parameters are taken from corresponding OPLS atom types, as specified in the comments.
